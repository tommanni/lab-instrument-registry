Connecting to the server (assuming you have the rights)
I'm not entirely sure if you are able to directly SSH into the server from tuni's local internet, you might or you might not.

Step 1 (Might not be needed inside tunis lan)
	ssh into linux-ssh.tuni.fi using commandline software of your choosing on windows that could be Powershell or cmd.
	You also need to request rights from tuni in order to connect to your linux desktop using ssh.
	Example command: ssh USERNAME@linux-ssh.tuni.fi
	
Step 2
	ssh into met-metlabs.rd.tuni.fi
	Example command: ssh met-metlabs.rd.tuni.fi



Locations of relevant files and folders inside the server
Source code and build: /var/www/html/metlabs
Apache config files: /etc/httpd/conf.d
	Relevant files being: metlabs.conf and django.conf
Service file for the backend: /etc/systemd/system
	Relevant file being: metlabs.service
	
in order to traverse between the folders in the server you use the command cd <location>
Example usage: cd /etc/httpd/conf.d

in order to list everything that resides inside a folder once you have traversed to it you can use the command ls
Example usage: ls

If you need to edit any of the configuration files you can either use vim or nano and you also require sudo in order to edit the files.
Example usage assuming our current path is /etc/systemd/system:
	sudo nano metlabs.service
(In order to save changes after editing using nano you press ctrl+X then y or n depending if you want to save (y) or discard (n) the changes and then Enter to keep the file name as is.)
	
In case you want to quickly check your current path you can use the command pwd
Example usage: pwd

Why the server might break?
Somebody changes the locations of the build/static files from front/back-end
	Steps to fix -> check through all 3 config files and check where they might be fetching their data from and check that the folder and files actually exist in the locations, if not change the required files to those locations or change the config files to point to the new locations. Then restart apache and/or metlabs service.
	If you edited the metlabs.service file run the commands
		sudo systemctl daemon-reload
		sudo systemctl restart metlabs
	if you edited the .conf files run the command
		sudo systemctl restart httpd

Backend for some reason doesn't have read/write/execute access to its required files or just overall doesn't function.
	steps to fix -> Identify the problem the easiest way is to probably check the status of metlabs.service running the command:
		sudo systemctl status metlabs
	This should display its current status and the error code it failed with. In case this doesn't give you enough information on what could be wrong you can check the full logs using command:
		sudo journalctl -u metlabs.service
	or command for only last 30 lines of logs:
		sudo journalctl -u metlabs -n 30 -f
		
Frontend should be harder to break since its served through apache and doesn't have anything too fancy

General tips:
Since I don't really know what problems could arise your best bet is to probably start googling the error codes that the logs point you towards.
The backend environment variables are defined in the metlabs.service and the password for the postgreSQL user is there also.

Steps to backup the data in the database
Commands to run:
	cd /var/www/html/metlabs/project-y-met-labs/Backend
	source venv/bin/activate
	python3.12 manage.py export_csv
	
Now you should have a file called laiterekisteri_....csv in order to check that it exists you can use the command: ls
In order to move this file to your personal computer or wherever I suggest using the command: scp and in case you used the linux-ssh.tuni.fi server to connect to the server you might need to move the file from the server to the linux desktop and from there to your pc
Example usage of scp while copying the backup from the server to linux desktop and from there to your local machine:
	On the met-metlabs.rd.tuni.fi server use the command:
		scp /var/www/html/metlabs/project-y-met-labs/Backend/laiterekisteri_2025-05-03.csv USERNAME@linux-ssh.tuni.fi:~/
			(hint you can use TAB to autofille the laiterekisteri files name after typing a few letters of it)
	After running that command open up a terminal on your local machine and run the command:
		scp USERNAME@linux-ssh.tuni.fi~/laiterekisteri_2025-05-03.csv path/on/your/local/machine

After these commands you should have a copy of the file on your pc.
